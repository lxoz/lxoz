Scrap yard for projects

Isn't it funny that we have so many unfinished ideas in our heads, we walk around with? And even more,
how many projects do lurk in the depth of local file systems?

Well, instead of continuing to accumulate those yet-to-complete thoughts and to-be cleaned source code somewhere, I am giving it a go and submitting it here on GitHub.
